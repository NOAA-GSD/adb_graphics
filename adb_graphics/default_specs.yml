# This file contains the defaults for the graphics for each variable. 
#
# Acceptable keys for a variable:
#
#   clevs: one of the following
#      - a list with no quotes
#      - a range specified as "range [list]" with quotes. Specify "list" as with
#      numpy.arange() like this -- [[start, ]stop[, increment]]]. start and
#      increment are options.
#      - the name of a function to be called that will return a list.
#
#   cmap: name of Python colormap
#
#   colors: name of function that defines a list of colors
#
#   subst: name of a section to copy settings from
#
#   transform: name of a function that will perform a given transformation of
#      the variable
#
#   unit: the resulting unit of the variable
#
#
# A few conventions must be followed for adding variables to this file.
#
#   Substitution:
#      To substitute parts of another section, use the "subst" key with a value
#      for the intended section to be substituted. This key is recognized by the
#      Python script that loads this file, and will substitute any fields that
#      do not already have a key, value pair for that section, but will not
#      override any that are currently set.
#
#   Naming:
#      The variable name chosen here is the short_name in the NetCDF file. This
#      is imposed by the Python class loading this file. Please add a comment to
#      describe the variable when adding it here.
#
#   Order:
#      Each set of items should be in alphabetical order for ease of code
#      maintenance.
